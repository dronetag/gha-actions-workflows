# Github Actions Shared Actions & Workflows

A collection of Github Actions Shared Actions and Workflows, mostly for internal use.

## Why is this repository public?

As of January 2022, GitHub supports reusable workflows for GitHub Actions only [for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows#access-to-reusable-workflows). This is a stubborn limitation we hope gets fixed soon, because we are really uncomfortable publishing our internal workflows publicly.

Not primarily for security reasons (but the risks, of course, exists), but more because we simply don't think that this is worth of a public repository. It's nothing interesting for our customers and partners and we feel ashamed, that this repository is present on our profile and shown to them.

## Like or hate what you see?

Do you find these workflows useful? Or think you'd done them better? We're hiring!
